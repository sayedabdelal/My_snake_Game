# Snake Game

This is a simple implementation of the classic Snake game using the `curses` library in Python.

## Installation

1. Make sure you have Python installed on your system.
2. Clone or download the project repository.

## Usage

Run the script using the following command:

```
python snake_game.py
```

Use the arrow keys (up, down, left, right) to control the snake. The objective of the game is to eat the food (O) and grow the snake without hitting the boundaries or itself. The game ends if the snake collides with the boundaries or itself.

This project requires the `curses` library, which is a built-in Python library for creating terminal-based user interfaces.
